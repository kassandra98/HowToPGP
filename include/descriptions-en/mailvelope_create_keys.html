Now, a window with the heading [„Einrichtung“, bitte übersetzen] should appear, else you click on "Key Management[Übersetzung korrekt?]" -- [„Einrichtung“, bitte übersetzen]. Now click here on the blue Button with the inscription „create keys“. <br> In the first two areas of the now appearing window, you type in your name (or a pseudonym) and your e-mail adress. Now you create a good password. Your Password
